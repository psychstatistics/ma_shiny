# Meta-analysis Shiny Application

Version 0.1

## Description

This is a Shiny App (http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/) for conducting a meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing family therapy to either control, treatment as usual, or an alternative treatment. The website for the current version of the app is:

http://shinyserver.byu.edu/ma_shiny

The app is pretty basic as it stands. In future releases we'd like to:

* Provide additional information regarding the data
* Provide additional methods for visualizing the data
* Provide more control over the meta-analysis itself, for example:
	* Control estimation method
	* Control whether small study corrections are included
	* Control how multiple effect sizes within a study are handled
	* Meta-regression and multivariate meta-analysis, etc.
* Allow users to download the data
* Provide the code used for the meta-analysis and plots for offline use
* Allow users to download the figures

Please let us know if find any errors. Thanks!
